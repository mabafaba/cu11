Jane Jacobs identified small street segments as an important feature of urban structures. Understanding the ground floor facade as the interface between buildings and the public space, we measured the ration between the ground area and the length of the outline of each building. This is an Indicator of the granularity of the urban structure. Looking at Berlin from this perspective, the post-war 'Plattenbauten' have a minimal interaction surface with the public space and rip wholes in the urban fabric.
